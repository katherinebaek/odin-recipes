    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Hamburger buns are a crucial component of the classic hamburger, providing the structure and stability needed to hold together the juicy patty, condiments, and toppings. Typically soft and slightly sweet, these buns are designed to complement the savory flavors of the meat and the various accompaniments. They come in various types, including sesame seed, brioche, whole wheat, and gluten-free options, each offering a unique texture and taste to enhance the overall burger experience. The light, airy nature of hamburger buns ensures they don't overwhelm the ingredients, allowing the flavors of the burger to shine through.</p>
    <p>Beyond their primary use in hamburgers, these versatile buns have found their way into a variety of other culinary applications. They are often used for sandwiches, pulled pork, sloppy joes, and even breakfast sandwiches. Toasting the buns can add a delightful crunch and prevent them from becoming soggy, especially when paired with juicy fillings. Whether enjoyed fresh out of the bag or lightly grilled, hamburger buns remain a staple in many kitchens, appreciated for their ability to elevate simple ingredients into satisfying, handheld meals.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>5 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) envelope active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the milk, 1 cup of water, butter, sugar and salt in a saucepan. Bring to a boil then remove from the heat and let stand until lukewarm. If the mixture is too hot, it will kill the yeast.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, stir together the flour and yeast. Pour in wet ingredients and stir until the dough starts to pull together. If you have a stand mixer, use the dough hook to mix for about 8 minutes. If not, knead the dough on a floured surface for about 10 minutes. Place the dough in a greased bowl, turning to coat. Cover and let stand until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Punch down the dough and divide into 12 portions They should be a little larger than a golf ball. Make tight balls out of the dough by pulling the dough tightly around and pinching it at the bottom. Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or aluminum foil. After the rolls sit for a minute and relax, flatten each ball with the palm of your hand until it is 3 to 4 inches wide. You may want to oil your hand first. Set rolls aside until they double in size, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Mix together the egg yolk and 1 tablespoon of water in a cup or small bowl. Brush onto the tops of the rolls. Position 2 oven racks so they are not too close to the top or bottom of the oven.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove the rolls from the oven and return them to different shelves so each one spends a little time on the top. Continue to bake for another 5 to 10 minutes, or until nicely browned on the top and bottom.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Coleslaw is a classic salad that combines finely shredded cabbage with a creamy or tangy dressing. Traditionally, the dressing is made from mayonnaise, vinegar, sugar, and a variety of seasonings, creating a harmonious blend of flavors that complements the crunchiness of the cabbage. Some variations also include carrots, onions, and even apples or raisins for added texture and sweetness. Coleslaw is often served as a side dish at barbecues, picnics, and family gatherings, providing a refreshing contrast to rich and savory main courses.</p>
    <p>In addition to its role as a beloved side dish, coleslaw is a versatile addition to many recipes. It can be used as a topping for sandwiches, burgers, and tacos, adding a crisp, refreshing bite to these dishes. Coleslaw is also appreciated for its health benefits, as cabbage is rich in vitamins C and K, as well as fiber. This makes it not only a tasty but also a nutritious choice. Whether enjoyed on its own or as part of a larger meal, coleslaw's balance of flavors and textures makes it a perennial favorite in many cuisines.</p>

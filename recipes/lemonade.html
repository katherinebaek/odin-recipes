    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lemonade, a refreshing and timeless beverage, is typically made from fresh lemon juice, water, and sugar. This simple combination of ingredients creates a tangy, sweet, and invigorating drink, perfect for quenching thirst on hot summer days. The tartness of the lemons balances beautifully with the sweetness of the sugar, making lemonade a popular choice for all ages. Additionally, it is often infused with other flavors such as mint, berries, or ginger to create exciting variations that cater to diverse palates.</p>
    <p>Beyond its delightful taste, lemonade holds cultural significance in many regions around the world. In the United States, it is often associated with childhood lemonade stands, symbolizing entrepreneurship and community spirit. Meanwhile, in countries like India, a variation known as "nimbu pani" incorporates spices like cumin and black salt, offering a unique and flavorful twist. Whether enjoyed at a family picnic, a local fair, or a casual gathering, lemonade remains a beloved and enduring drink that brings people together.</p>
